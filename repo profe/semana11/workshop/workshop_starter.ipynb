    "- [ ] My hook is memorable and relevant\n",
    "- [ ] I explain WHY this matters, not just WHAT I found\n",
    "- [ ] I have ONE clear key insight (not a list)\n",
    "- [ ] My visualizations are simple and readable\n",
    "- [ ] I end with specific, actionable recommendations\n",
    "- [ ] My pitch fits in 5 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting with methodology instead of the problem\n",
    "2. Including too many findings (pick your best one)\n",
    "3. Charts with too much detail or unclear labels\n",
    "4. Ending with \"any questions?\" instead of a strong close\n",
    "5. Reading from slides instead of telling a story"
