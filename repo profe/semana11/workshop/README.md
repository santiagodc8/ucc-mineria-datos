## Part 1: The 5-Slide Framework (30 minutes)

Your presentation must follow this structure:

### Slide 1: The Hook
**Purpose**: Grab attention and establish relevance

- Start with a surprising fact, question, or problem statement
- Make the audience care in the first 30 seconds
- Avoid: title slides with just your name and project title

**Example**: "Every day, our company loses $6,500 to customer churn. Today I'll show you how we can cut that by 40%."

### Slide 2: The Situation
**Purpose**: Set the context

- What data did you analyze?
- What was the business/research question?
- Why does this matter?
- Keep it brief - this is setup, not the main event

### Slide 3: The Key Insight
**Purpose**: Deliver your main finding

- ONE central insight (not a list of findings)
- Support with a clear, simple visualization
- Use the "newspaper headline" test: could this be a headline?
- This is the heart of your presentation

### Slide 4: The Evidence
**Purpose**: Build credibility

- Show 2-3 supporting data points
- Address potential objections ("But what about...?")
- Include methodology notes if relevant
- Keep visualizations simple and readable

### Slide 5: The Call to Action
**Purpose**: Drive decision-making

- Specific, actionable recommendations
- Expected impact (quantified if possible)
- Next steps and timeline
- End with confidence, not "any questions?"

## Part 2: Pitch Guidelines (15 minutes practice)

### Time Allocation (5 minutes total)
- Hook: 30 seconds
- Situation: 45 seconds
- Key Insight: 90 seconds
- Evidence: 90 seconds
- Call to Action: 30 seconds

### Delivery Tips

**Do:**
- Make eye contact with your audience
- Use simple language (no jargon without explanation)
- Pause after key points
- Point to specific parts of visualizations
- End with a clear recommendation

**Don't:**
- Read from your slides
- Apologize for your data or analysis
- Rush through the ending
- Use phrases like "I just want to show..." or "This is just..."
- End with "That's it" or "Any questions?"

### Practice Checklist

Before presenting, verify:
- [ ] Each slide has ONE main point
- [ ] Visualizations are readable from the back of the room
- [ ] You can explain each chart in one sentence
- [ ] Your pitch fits in 5 minutes (practice with a timer)
- [ ] You have a strong opening and closing line

---

## Part 3: Peer Feedback Session (45 minutes)

### Group Formation
- Form groups of 4 students
- Each person presents (5 min) + receives feedback (5-7 min)

### Feedback Protocol

**For Presenters:**
1. Present your 5-minute pitch
2. Listen to feedback without defending
3. Take notes on suggestions
4. Ask clarifying questions if needed

**For Reviewers:**
Use the feedback form in the workshop notebook. Focus on:

1. **Clarity**: Did you understand the main point?
2. **Evidence**: Was the data convincing?
3. **Action**: Do you know what to do next?
4. **Engagement**: Did the story hold your attention?

### Feedback Framework: "I Like, I Wish, What If"

- **I like...** (what worked well)
- **I wish...** (what could be improved)
- **What if...** (suggestions to try)

**Example:**
- "I like how you quantified the business impact upfront"
- "I wish the key insight slide had a clearer headline"
- "What if you started with a customer story instead of the data overview?"

## Deliverables

By the end of this workshop, you should have:

1. **5-slide presentation** (PDF or slides format)
2. **Completed peer feedback forms** (for each group member)
3. **Revised pitch notes** based on feedback received

## Evaluation Criteria

Your final project presentation will be evaluated on:

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Story Structure | 25% | Clear narrative arc with hook, insight, and action |
| Data Visualization | 25% | Charts are clear, appropriate, and support the story |
| Insight Quality | 25% | Main finding is meaningful and well-supported |
| Delivery | 25% | Confident, clear, within time limit |

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with the end**: What do you want your audience to DO after your presentation?
2. **Cut ruthlessly**: If a slide doesn't advance your story, remove it
3. **Test your visuals**: Show them to someone unfamiliar with your project
4. **Practice out loud**: Silent practice doesn't reveal timing or awkward phrasing
5. **Embrace feedback**: The best presenters are the best listeners

*Good luck with your presentations!*
