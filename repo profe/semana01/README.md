## Self-Reflection Questions

After watching the videos and reading, think about:

1. What aspect of data analytics interests you most?
2. Can you think of a problem in your life or work that data could help solve?
3. Which phase of CRISP-DM sounds most challenging to you?

## Deliverable

Write a **1-paragraph reflection** (100-200 words) answering:

> "What interests me most about data analytics and why?"

Save this reflection - you'll share it in the Week 2 class.
